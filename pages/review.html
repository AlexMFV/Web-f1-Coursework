      <h1>{ Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web }</h1>

      <p>We are more connected to the digital world than we have imagined, especially as a result of increasing dependence on social networks. Technology and devices connected to the Internet are already part of our daily lives. They are present on all sides. From social networks to work email, from smartphone always handy to a smart TV in the living room, we are always accessing content, receiving information, exchanging messages or enjoying some entertainment. It is undeniable that all this technology has brought many benefits to our lives. We are constantly exposing the “Intellectual property, personally identifiable information, credit card data, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive data” <b>[1] (Samir Kapuria; n.d)</b> into the disposal of people who also access social networks, leaving digital footprints in all queries through the search engine. Most of the time that data is collected by small and medium companies that later sell that data to bigger companies while bringing benefits to both ends.
      </p>
      <p>But a cyber attacks study concluded that "65.2% of cyber attacks are targeted at small businesses" <b>[4] (Fiesp; 2015 p.2)</b> while another study made confirms that "Brazil is one of the countries with the most cyber attacks filed between 2015 and 2016 having been redistributed more than 199 million malicious emails" <b>[4] (Kaspersky Lab; 2016 p.2).</b> And with most of these attacks, there are data leaks that might affect the consumer as well as the company itself.</p>

      <h1>{ Reducing your exposure }</h1>

      <p>“Some of the ways to reduce exposure to the more common types of cyber attacks on systems that are publicly accessible on the Internet is to keep the software of your daily devices up-to-date by install patches that might contain fixes for present or upcoming vulnerabilities in the software code” <b>[2] (NCSC; 2016)</b>, which is a common way for a hacker to take over your device and personal information while you use the device. Likewise, if someone tries to access our data usually it is protected by any means ranging from fingerprints to many types of encryptions and even “text-based passwords which are the most common type of protection we use" <b>[5] (Password Policies; n.d p.1)</b> but while it being only text we can protect ourselves anyways by making those passwords complex so that it makes it difficult for a hacker to "crack" them. That's why numerous websites that require a user to create an account provide some policies for the passwords so that it prevents the user from creating a simple password, maintaining a minimum layer of protection.
      </p>
      <p>“We can adopt some other ways of protection methods like the use of VPNs, web proxies, changing the policies of the firewall, etc. So that by adopting any of these methods, we are adding an extra layer of protection since some of them prevent our system or device from connecting directly to the Internet, and with that reducing the risk of attack and preserving our privacy.” <b>[9] (NCSC; 2016)</b></p>
      <p>If we use publicly available devices to access the internet or any other service where we need to insert our credentials for example bank account or social media accounts we can not forget to sign out. So that it prevents our data from being exposed to another person that uses the device. This same rule applies for when connecting to public networks because the vulnerability of a connection might jeopardise our data and private information. Another way to preserve our data is by using cloud-based servers like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., and it is better to store the data in password-compressed files. So even if someone gains access to the data they will not be able to see the contents of it.
      “In 2012 the famous cloud-based file sharing service Dropbox announced that there has been a breach in the system. But only 4 years later people know what happened. Hackers stole more than 68 million user accounts, including email addresses and passwords all of the collected data, reached 5 gigabytes in file size.” <b>[6] (Contel Bradford; 2016)</b>
      </p>

      <h1>{ Keeping it safe }</h1>

      <p>Although there are many ways in which our personal data can be obtained Phishing is one of the most common because sometimes it is hard to differentiate between a fraudulent and a safe action. “Phishing consists on an attacker, also called as phisher attempting to fraudulently obtain confidential or sensitive data by tricking the end user into believing that he comes from a trustworthy company or service” <b>[8] (Junxiao Shi, Sara Saleem; n.d, p.1).</b> “Data collected by IntSights, between 2017 and 2018 about fraudulent online purchases was used in a study that concluded that there was a spike of about 297% in the increasing number of fraudulent and fake websites dedicated to eCommerce, used to steal customer information as well as money.” <b>[7] (Riskified; 2017 - IntSights; 2017 p.6)</b></p>
      <p>But we can reduce that risk of having our information stolen by establishing and maintaining malware defences on social networks and being aware of the degree of privacy of what is posted anywhere on the internet. Keeping your privacy setting fully open, on social media, is always a risk of exposing your information to people you do not know.</p>

      <h1>{ Conclusion }</h1>

      <p>Finally, in any connection it is necessary to be totally cautious, that is, the user should make a careful selection on what links can and can not be opened and, in any case, leave his login and password recorded on the device, changing the password frequently.
      Adopting these attitudes and being always aware of security and privacy issues is very important to preserve our privacy and minimize the chances of having our data stolen since we already know that we can trust nothing and no one on the internet and while there are good things about the virtual world there are too many flaws, and evil people that have other intentions for us not to care enough.
